# Arunkumar.dev
My personal website and blog.

# Building

* Setup ruby on your system.
* Run `gem install bundler jekyll` to install Jekyll.

See full `jekyll` guide [here](https://jekyllrb.com/).

# Editor

Preferred editor is VS Code. The repo has a `tasks.json` file to add few custom build tasks to VS Code. Namely `firebase serve` and `jekyll serve`.
