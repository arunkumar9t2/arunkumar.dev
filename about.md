#### About Me

Hello :wave: this is Arun.

I enjoy working with the Android platform specializing in architecture, UX and design and have worked with apps of varying sizes. My passion for Android dates back to college and I have been also an independent developer with 8 published apps on Play Store that have cumulatively crossed several thousand downloads while maintaining 4.5~ rating from several thousand reviewers. Some of the popular apps include Lynket and Iconzy.

During the day, I work with *[Grab](https://www.grab.com/sg/)* as a Mobile Platform Engineer (Android). Outside work, I enjoy working on various side projects and open source software. These side projects are a playground to try new things to keep up with the ever evolving Android stack. When I am not coding, I play PC games and build DIY projects.
